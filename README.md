Pros of software engineering with ChatGPT
  It can decrease time spent coding.
  Can generate blocks for more simple concepts fairly right.

Cons of software engineering with ChatGPT
  Generated code may not be correct
  More time might be spent debugging broken code instead of generating correct code
  It doesn't have originality, it just takes from previously provided data
  It can write literal code but it does not have the complex human mind to design a whole system
  You cannot blindly trust it
  It may attempt to generate code for a different type of project.
  Knowing the frequency of which users on stackoverflow suggest doing things X way
    after you had asked specifically for Y, an AI may provide outputs for the wrong 
    type of system, or even the wrong language or version of a language, because
    people frequently share what they know and are comfortable with, rather than 
    whats applicable.
